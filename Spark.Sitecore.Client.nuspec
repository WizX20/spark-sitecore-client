	<description>
		All of these fields have been tested against Sitecore 6.6.x. Most should work with Sitecore 7.x
		Fields Included:
		
		Filtered Tree,
		Queryable Treelist,
		Site-Based Droptree,
		Site-Based Image,
		Site-Based Multilist,
		Site-Based Treelist,
		Tokenized List
		
		Thank you to Ed Lane for his help in porting some of these to Sitecore 6.6 and for his work on Tokenized List.
